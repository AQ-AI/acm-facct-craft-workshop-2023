![Humanitarian AI for the Global South](media/single-page-markdown-website.svg)

This workshop is intended to give CRAFT attendees an opportunity for deep exploration of the challenges of developing, implementing, and regulating AI for the Global South. We intend to build on the works of ![UNOCHA report “ML in Practice”](https://partnershiponai.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/PAI_about-ml-in-practice-UNOCHA.pdf) with Partnership on AI, and ![Humdata’s Peer Review framework](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/2048a947-5714-4220-905b-e662cbcd14c8/resource/76e488d9-b69d-41bd-927c-116d633bac7b/download/peer-review-framework-2020.pdf) for predictive analytics in Humanitarian Response to bring together a global community of researchers, practitioners and policy-makers around the topic of AI for Humanitarian Development.

We will explore the above topic through a case study of a social enterprise supported by an international Non-Governmental Organization (NGO)  who are building AI to highlight the environmental and health challenges faced by children. As the World Health Organization (WHO) ![pointed out](https://www.who.int/news/item/04-04-2022-billions-of-people-still-breathe-unhealthy-air-new-who-data), “Almost the entire global population (99%) breathes air that exceeds WHO air quality limits, and threatens their health.” With this premise, the case study will discuss the implementation of AI to measure children's exposure in the global south to harmful air pollutants that can lead to respiratory illness. Participants will be introduced to the potential pitfalls of deploying such a set of algorithms, such as the need for explainability and verifiability, regulatory components, and the participatory challenge. We invite participants to introduce further use cases for AI development in areas such as agriculture, healthcare, and education and how these technologies can have a significant impact on the quality of life for millions of people in these regions. 

# Agenda

After introducing the case study, we will invite 3-4 speakers, covering diverse stakeholder perspectives—decision-makers, AI regulators, and Industry practitioners, among others—in this case study. We then break out the attendees into a number of focus groups. Each group will be given a particular challenge, such as:
- Issues related to data availability and different forms of knowledge, such as labeling and data quality
- Nuances about data privacy and AI ethics unique to the global south
- Capacity building and collaboration
We will invite the participants to draw on their diverse experiences and expertise to dive deep into their assigned challenge area, and come up with proposals of potential solutions.

The workshop will end with a group discussion with all participants. Representatives of each breakout group will briefly present the outcomes from their respective group discussion.
